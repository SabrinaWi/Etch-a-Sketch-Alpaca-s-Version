The Odin Project's Etch-A-Sketch Project, as found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

Will I find a way to sneak alpacas into this project?

We will see...

But it can't hurt to keep me caffeinated, that usually leads to a hightened chance of alpacas. :D

Finished the project.

Main points I'm taking away from this:

- Even when I add things "in the heat of the moment" while trying to make my code work, it is a good idea to go through everything again later and put similar things (e.g. set "active" class to specific buttons) into reusable functions. Makes everything easier to read.
- Adding several things to the same event listener can be a bit tricky, but I now have some working examples in my code that I can copy and modify for future projects.
- CSS doesn't just hate me, it hates everyone, but it can be conquered. Maybe.
- Still need to learn a lot about making sites visually appealing.
- This was fun.
