# etch-a-sketch

The Odin Project's Etch-A-Sketch Project, as found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

Will I find a way to sneak alpacas into this project? 

We will see...

But it can't hurt to keep me caffeinated, that usually leads to a hightened chance of alpacas. :D
